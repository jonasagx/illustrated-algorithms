Algorithms can be hard, or coding, like a lot of people call it. It bothers me how the methods, and instructions that control a lot of our world are seen as code like "Greek", "Chinese" are figures of speech for "I don't know a thing".

What if coding, and computers were broken down as a list of simple concepts, that interface each other and grown in complexity as new ones are added. I tried to teach coding before, and failed, I taught it like my college professors did, my cousin hated and quit after 2 classes.
